This dataset is released under Creative Commons by Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Australia (CC BY-NC 3.0). IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MARINE USERS The Commonwealth marine reserves declared in November 2012 are under transitional arrangements until management plans come into effect in July 2014. Transitional arrangements involve NO CHANGES ON THE WATER for marine users. Note, there are no changes to management arrangements in the marine reserves that existed prior to the establishment of the new reserves, that is, the same restrictions on activities will continue to apply even where those reserves have been incorporated into new reserves. The South-east Network of Commonwealth Marine Reserves are managed under the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network Management Plan 2013-23, in place from 1 July 2013. More information is available at www.environment.gov.au/marinereserves This data contains spatial and contextual information about Commonwealth Marine Reserves under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth governments Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which are managed by the Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPaC). It does not include data on MPA's in other Australian jurisdictions (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, State/Territory parks), or Terrestrial Protected Areas with marine components (eg Pulu Keeling National Park).",

			"metadataText": "Key ecological features are the parts of the marine ecosystem that are considered to be of importance for a marine region's biodiversity or ecosystem function and integrity. Key ecological features (KEFs) meet one or more of the following criteria: 1. a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species); 2. a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity; 3. an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for: a) enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface); b) aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas); c) biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or 4. a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance. KEFs have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area. A workshop held in Darwin in 2007 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features. As new information becomes available, the spatial representations of identified key ecological features will continue to be refined and updated. Sixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region: 1. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands 2. Perth Canyon and adjacent shelf break, and other west coast canyons 3. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to the west coast inshore lagoons 4. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to Geographe Bay 5. Cape Mentelle upwelling 6. Naturaliste Plateau 7. Diamantina Fracture Zone 8. Albany Canyons group and adjacent shelf break 9. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Recherche Archipelago 10. Ancient coastline at 90-120 m depth 11. Kangaroo Island Pool, canyons and adjacent shelf break, and Eyre Peninsula upwellings. 12. Meso-scale eddies (points). 13. Western demersal slope and associated fish communities. 14. Western rock lobster. 15. Benthic invertebrate communities of the eastern Great Australian Bight. No spatial representation available. 16. Small pelagic fish of the South-west Marine Region. No spatial representation available. Thirteen KEFs have been identified in the North-west Marine Region: 1. Ancient coastline at 125 m depth contour 2. Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island and surrounding Commonwealth waters 3. Canyons linking the Argo Abyssal Plain and Scott Plateau 4. Canyons linking the Cuvier Abyssal Plain and the Cape Range Peninsula 5. Carbonate bank and terrace system of the Sahul Shelf 6. Commonwealth waters adjacent to Ningaloo Reef 7. Continental Slope Demersal Fish Communities 8. Exmouth Plateau 9. Glomar Shoals 10. Mermaid Reed and Commonwealth waters surrounding the Rowley Shoals 11. Pinnacles of the Bonaparte Basin 12. Seringapatam Reef and Commonwealth waters in the Scott Reef Complex 13. Wallaby Saddle Eight KEFs have been identified in the North Marine Region: 1. Carbonate bank and terrace system of the Van Diemen Rise 2. Shelf break and slope of the Arafura Shelf 3. Tributary canyons of the Arafura Depression 4. Gulf of Carpentaria basin 5. Gulf of Carpentaria coastal zone 6. Plateaux and saddle north-west of the Wellesley Islands 7. Pinnacles of the Bonaparte Basin 8. Submerged coral reefs of the Gulf of Carpentaria Three KEFs have been identified in the Coral Sea: 1. Tasmantid seamount chain 2. Reefs, cays and hebivorous fish of the Queensland Plateau 3. Reefs, cays and hebivorous fish of the Marion Plateau Eight KEFs were identified in the Temperate East marine Region: 1. Tasmantid seamount chain 2. Lord Howe seamount chain 3. Norfolk Ridge 4. Canyons on the eastern continental slope 5. Shelf rocky reefs 6. Elizabeth and Middleton reefs 7. Upwelling off Fraser Island 8. Tasman Front and eddy field Eight KEFs were identified in the South-east Marine Region. 1. Seamounts, east and south of Tasmania 2. West Tasmanian canyons 3. Bonney coast upwelling 4. Upwelling east of Eden 5. Big Horseshoe canyon 6. East Tasmania tropical convergence zone. No spatial representation available 7. Bass cascade. No spatial representation available 8. Shelf rocky reefs and hard substrate. No spatial representation available In order to create a spatial representation of KEFs for each Marine Region, some interpretation of the information was required. The Department has made every effort to use the best available spatial information and best judgement on how to spatially represent the features based on the scientific advice provided. This does not preclude others from making their own interpretation of available information.",

This layer depicts the number of times that a satellite observation was clear for the 1987 to 2014 period, as produced by the Water Observation from Space analysis procedure. A clear observation is defined as one where the observation was not disrupted by cloud, shadows (including terrain shadows) or satellite sensor issues. Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 satellite imagery acquired over Australia between 1987 and 2014. The Landsat data underpinning WOfS is ARG25 standard data located in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. The WOfS product is calculated from all acceptable Landsat scenes in the Geoscience Australia archive for the time period. The detection process is based on spectral analysis of each pixel in each Landsat scene. The water detection algorithm used to detect water from each observed pixel is based on a statistical regression tree analysis of a set of normalised difference indices and corrected band values. The regression is based on a set of water and non-water samples created by visual interpretation of 20 Landsat scenes from across Australia. The sample locations, ensure that the logistic regression is based on the full geographic range of conditions experienced in Australia. The regression analysis determined a set of best indices and bands for the analysis and the associated thresholds in each component to derive a final classification tree, producing a water/non-water classification for every pixel in the Data Cube. The final water classification for each pixel is modified by Pixel Quality (see associated RG25 - PQ product information) and terrain. Once the water algorithm has completed its process, the water detection for a pixel through time is combined to produce a total number of water observations for each pixel. This is compared to a total number of clear observations for the same pixel, derived from the PQ analysis. The ratio is expressed as a percentage water recurrence. A separate analysis produces a confidence dataset, providing an assessment on whether a pixel depicted as having had water detected at some time is likely. The layer is computed by combining a set of confidence factors using a weighted sum approach, with the weightings derived by logistic regression.",

The dataset covers the north-northwest region of the Australian continental EEZ. This dataset supersedes previous predictions of seabed gravel content for the region with demonstrated improvements in accuracy. Accuracy of predictions varies based on density of underlying data and level of seabed complexity. Artefacts occur in this dataset as a result of insufficient samples in relevant areas. This dataset is intended for use at regional scale. The dataset may not be appropriate for use at local scales in areas where sample density is insufficient to detect local variation in sediment properties. To obtain the most accurate interpretation of sediment distribution in these areas, it is recommended that additional samples be collected and interpolations updated.

Data is displayed according to the sampling method. The geocat for this dataset is 69869. The MARS database contains detailed information on seabed sediment characteristics for samples collected from Australia's marine jurisdiction, including the Australian Antarctic Territory. It is an important scientific resource that includes survey and sample information such as locations, water depths and sample descriptions. Data are also provided from quantitative analyses of the sediments, such as grain size, mud, sand, gravel and carbonate concentrations, mineralogy, age determinations, geochemical properties, and physical attributes for down-core samples including bulk density, p-wave velocity, porosity and magnetic susceptibility. New data are being added as they become available. Please contact us at marine.sediments@ga.gov.au if you wish to contribute marine sediment data to the MARS database or access the database at http://dbforms.ga.gov.au/pls/www/npm.mars.search",

The dataset covers the north-northwest region of the Australian continental EEZ. This dataset supersedes previous predictions of seabed mud content for the region with demonstrated improvements in accuracy. Accuracy of predictions varies based on density of underlying data and level of seabed complexity. Artefacts occur in this dataset as a result of insufficient samples in relevant areas. This dataset is intended for use at regional scale. The dataset may not be appropriate for use at local scales in areas where sample density is insufficient to detect local variation in sediment properties. To obtain the most accurate interpretation of sediment distribution in these areas, it is recommended that additional samples be collected and interpolations updated.

The data acquisition was carried out in Australia from 1949-2012 by Geoscience Australia and various partners. The set of reflection and refraction data comprises over 12,000 km of coverage, and provides an insight into the variations in crustal architecture in the varied geological domains. The complete processed dataset was first available for public access in Oct 2013 (http://www.ga.gov.au/minerals/projects/current-projects/seismic-acquisition-processing.html ). The location of seismic traverses is shown by the Gallery link on the webpage. The new survey data will be updated on the webpage by the official data release date. The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information. The onshore seismic data were collected with partner organizations: Australian Geodynamics Cooperative Research Centre, National Research Facility for Earth Sounding, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, Curtin University of Technology, Geological Survey of New South Wales, NSW Department of Mineral Resources, NSW Department of Primary Industries Mineral Resources, An organisation for a National Earth Science Infrastructure Program, Geological Survey Western Australia, Northern Territory Geological Survey, Primary Industries and Resources South Australia, Predictive Mineral Discovery Cooperative Research Centre, Queensland Geological Survey, GeoScience Victoria Department of Primary Industries, Tasmania Development and Resources, University of Western Australia.",

This image only includes airborne-derived TMI data for onshore and near-offshore continental areas. Since the fifth edition was released in 2010 data from 41 new surveys have been added to the database, acquired mainly by the State and Territory Geological Surveys. It is estimated that 31 500 000 line-kilometres of survey data were acquired to produce the grid data, 4 500 000 line-kilometres more than for the previous edition. Details of the specifications of individual airborne surveys can be found in the Fourteenth Edition of the Index of Airborne Geophysical Surveys (Percival, 2014). Matching of the grids in the database was achieved using a program called Gridmerge, which was originally developed within Geoscience Australia and has now been commercialised. This program was used to merge 41 new surveys to the 5th Edition Total Magnetic Intensity Anomaly Grid of Australia (Milligan et al., 2010). The 5th Edition merged 795 individual grids to create the compilation and to constrain long wavelengths, an independent data set, the Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, was used to control the base levels of those survey grids which overlapped the AWAGS data (Milligan et al., 2009). As the 5th Edition was used as a base grid for the Gridmerge operation the new 6th Edition is essentially levelled to AWAGS. Individual and merged grids may be downloaded from the Geophysical Archive Data Delivery System (GADDS) on the Australian Government's Geoscience Portal at http://www.geoscience.gov.au/gadds.

As the second edition was used as a base grid for the Gridmerge operation the new Third Edition is essentially levelled to AWAGS. Filtering: Potassium, uranium, thorium and dose rate grids are available in both filtered and unfiltered versions. The low-pass filtering was achieved by applying a 7-point, degree-3 Savitzky-Golay filter (Savitzky and Golay, 1964) to each of the original survey grids prior to grid merging.",

The dataset covers the north-northwest region of the Australian continental EEZ. This dataset supersedes previous predictions of seabed sand content for the region with demonstrated improvements in accuracy. Accuracy of predictions varies based on density of underlying data and level of seabed complexity. Artefacts occur in this dataset as a result of insufficient samples in relevant areas. This dataset is intended for use at regional scale. The dataset may not be appropriate for use at local scales in areas where sample density is insufficient to detect local variation in sediment properties. To obtain the most accurate interpretation of sediment distribution in these areas, it is recommended that additional samples be collected and interpolations updated. The dataset can be downloaded at the following URL http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/76999.",

Recognised in marine bioregional plans as potential biodiversity hotspots, many of these canyons sit within the new national network of Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This GIS polygon layer contains 753 submarine canyons along the Australian continental margin and external territories. The locations and extents of these canyons were derived from a range of bathymetry datasets. The layer has attributes describing the canyon's shape, morphometric and geographic characteristics. The definitions are as follows. SHAPE_Leng: Perimeter SHAPE_Area: Planar area centreli_L: Centreline length; total length of canyon/sub-canyons centreline(s) MBG_Width: Minimum bounding rectangle width MBG_Length: Minimum bounding rectangle length MBG_Orient: Minimum bounding rectangle orientation len_wid_ra: Length to width ratio; a measure of elongation; larger the value the more elongate the canyon border_ind: Border index; a measure of geometric complexity; larger he value the more fractal the canyon compactnes: a measure of compactness; larger the value the more compact the canyon (or the smaller its border) no_branch: Number of sub-canyons head_incis: Head incision; incision deph of canyon head head_depth: Head depth; water depth of canyon head foot_depth: Foot depth; water depth of canyon foot depth_rang: Depth range; depth range between canyon head and foot slope_mean: Slope mean; average slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_std: Slope standard deviation; standard deviation of the slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_rang: Slope range; range between maximum and minimum slope gradients within canyon polygon surArea1: Surface area; 3-D surface area of canyon rugosity: Rugosity; roughness of canyon surface volume: Volume; 3-D volume enclosed by the canyon bottom and walls head_x: X coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection head_y: Y coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_x: X coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_y: Y coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection h_f_dist: Head to foot distance; euclidian distance between canyon head and foot h_f_slope: head to foot slope; slope gradient between canyon head and foot dist_shelf: Distance to shelf; euclidian distance of canyon to shelf break; a distance of zero indicates that canyon touchs or intersects the shelf break or within the continental shelf near_canyo: Nearest canyon; euclidian distance to the nearest canyon dist_coast: Distance to coast; euclidian distance of canyon to Australian coast focal_var: Focal variety; number of neighbouring canyons within a nominated proximity inci_depth: Incision depth; averged depth of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero inci_area: Incision area; area of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero slope15: Percentage of slope gradient greater than 15 degree; percentage of canyon area with slope gradients greater than 15 degree sinuosity: a measure of the quality of being sinuous; larger the value the more sinuous the canyon shelf_inci: Shelf incision; shlef-incising canyons have value of 1; slope-confined canyons have value of zero dist_river: Distance to revier; euclidian distance to the mouth of the nearest permanent river uncertain: Uncertainty; mapping uncertainty assigned to canyon; larger the value the more uncertain the mapping is marine_reg: Marine region; the location of the canyon in one of the marine regions canyon_nam: The name of canyon if known map_region: Map region; the location of canyon in one of the map regions Please refer to Marine Geology 357, 362-383 for details of mapping methods.",

It also contains 1:5M data for geological regions and metamorphic geology. The 1:1M data is limited so that it does not display at scales less than 1:1,500,000. The 1:2.5M data is limited so that it does not display at scales greater than 1:1,500,000. The data represents outcropping or near-outcropping bedrock units, and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock. Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic name and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source. Layers are available for geological units coloured by lithostratigraphy, age, and lithology. The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.",

This image only includes airborne-derived TMI data for onshore and near-offshore continental areas. Since the fifth edition was released in 2010 data from 41 new surveys have been added to the database, acquired mainly by the State and Territory Geological Surveys. It is estimated that 31 500 000 line-kilometres of survey data were acquired to produce the grid data, 4 500 000 line-kilometres more than for the previous edition. Details of the specifications of individual airborne surveys can be found in the Fourteenth Edition of the Index of Airborne Geophysical Surveys (Percival, 2014). Matching of the grids in the database was achieved using a program called Gridmerge, which was originally developed within Geoscience Australia and has now been commercialised. This program was used to merge 41 new surveys to the 5th Edition Total Magnetic Intensity Anomaly Grid of Australia (Milligan et al., 2010). The 5th Edition merged 795 individual grids to create the compilation and to constrain long wavelengths, an independent data set, the Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, was used to control the base levels of those survey grids which overlapped the AWAGS data (Milligan et al., 2009). As the 5th Edition was used as a base grid for the Gridmerge operation the new 6th Edition is essentially levelled to AWAGS. Individual and merged grids may be downloaded from the Geophysical Archive Data Delivery System (GADDS) on the Australian Government's Geoscience Portal at http://www.geoscience.gov.au/gadds.

Individual and merged grids may be downloaded from the Geophysical Archive Data Delivery System (GADDS) on the Australian Government's Geoscience Portal at http://www.geoscience.gov.au/gadds.

This layer depicts the confidence in the water observations displayed in the water summary layer according to comparison with other national data. Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 satellite imagery acquired over Australia between 1987 and 2014. The Landsat data underpinning WOfS is ARG25 standard data located in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. The WOfS product is calculated from all acceptable Landsat scenes in the Geoscience Australia archive for the time period. The detection process is based on spectral analysis of each pixel in each Landsat scene. The water detection algorithm used to detect water from each observed pixel is based on a statistical regression tree analysis of a set of normalised difference indices and corrected band values. The regression is based on a set of water and non-water samples created by visual interpretation of 20 Landsat scenes from across Australia. The sample locations, ensure that the logistic regression is based on the full geographic range of conditions experienced in Australia. The regression analysis determined a set of best indices and bands for the analysis and the associated thresholds in each component to derive a final classification tree, producing a water/non-water classification for every pixel in the Data Cube. The final water classification for each pixel is modified by Pixel Quality (see associated RG25 - PQ product information) and terrain. Once the water algorithm has completed its process, the water detection for a pixel through time is combined to produce a total number of water observations for each pixel. This is compared to a total number of clear observations for the same pixel, derived from the PQ analysis. The ratio is expressed as a percentage water recurrence. A separate analysis produces a confidence dataset, providing an assessment on whether a pixel depicted as having had water detected at some time is likely. The layer is computed by combining a set of confidence factors using a weighted sum approach, with the weightings derived by logistic regression.",

This layer depicts the number of times that water was detected across Australia between 1987 and 2014, as produced by the Water Observation from Space analysis procedure. Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 satellite imagery acquired over Australia between 1987 and 2014. The Landsat data underpinning WOfS is ARG25 standard data located in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. The WOfS product is calculated from all acceptable Landsat scenes in the Geoscience Australia archive for the time period. The detection process is based on spectral analysis of each pixel in each Landsat scene. The water detection algorithm used to detect water from each observed pixel is based on a statistical regression tree analysis of a set of normalised difference indices and corrected band values. The regression is based on a set of water and non-water samples created by visual interpretation of 20 Landsat scenes from across Australia. The sample locations, ensure that the logistic regression is based on the full geographic range of conditions experienced in Australia. The regression analysis determined a set of best indices and bands for the analysis and the associated thresholds in each component to derive a final classification tree, producing a water/non-water classification for every pixel in the Data Cube. The final water classification for each pixel is modified by Pixel Quality (see associated RG25 - PQ product information) and terrain. Once the water algorithm has completed its process, the water detection for a pixel through time is combined to produce a total number of water observations for each pixel. This is compared to a total number of clear observations for the same pixel, derived from the PQ analysis. The ratio is expressed as a percentage water recurrence. A separate analysis produces a confidence dataset, providing an assessment on whether a pixel depicted as having had water detected at some time is likely. The layer is computed by combining a set of confidence factors using a weighted sum approach, with the weightings derived by logistic regression.",
