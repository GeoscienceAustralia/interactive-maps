Bathymetry is the study and mapping of seafloor topography. It involves obtaining measurements of the depth of the ocean and is the marine equivalent to mapping the topography on land. This map depicts a collection of the highest resolution bathymetric data publically available for download. The highest resolution bathymetric grids come from individual Geoscience Australia marine surveys. This interactive map also shows the lower resolution 50 m bathymetry data coverage (multibeam only), and  the Australian Bathymetry and Topography Grid, June 2009 at a spatial resolution of 9 arc seconds (0.0025 degrees or ~250 m at the equator).

The 2009  Australian Bathymetry and Topography Grid is a compilation of data acquired from:
</p>
<p>
- Multibeam (swath) echosounders</br>
- Airborne laser measurements (LADS)</br>
- Derived depths from satellite remote sensing</br>
- Singlebeam echosounders</br>
