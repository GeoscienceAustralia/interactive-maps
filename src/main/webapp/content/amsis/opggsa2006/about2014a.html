	 Petroleum Blocks cut to the AMB 2014a epoch. This dataset is a digital realisation of the Blocks as defined under Section 33 (3) of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. The blocks are created using a 5 minute by 5 minute graticular section that has been trimmed to the extent of the Offshore Area (defined in the same Act). The dataset is comprised of both points and polygons, and is densified to ensure the geometry will remain correct regardless of projection. The dataset's coverage includes areas of coastal waters and land within the constitutional limits of the States and territories, however in these areas the data is indicative only. For titles within the limits of the coastal waters, the relevant State agency should be consulted.
