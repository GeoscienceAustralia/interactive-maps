	According to the World Gold Council, trade in physical gold during 2012 amounted to 4452 tonnes. This is almost 1800 tonnes more than world mine production for the year as estimated by the United States Geological Survey (2660 tonnes; adjusted for actual Australian production). World Gold Council data shows jewellery consumed 1908 tonnes, bullion and coins 1582 tonnes and technology applications 428 tonnes. Central Banks were again net purchasers of gold during 2012.

	The monthly price of gold started 2012 at US$1744 an ounce (oz) and ended the year at US$1664/oz having bottomed at US$1558 in May and reaching a maximum of US$1776/oz in September (Figure 1). For most of the year the exchange rate between the Australian and United States dollars varied between 1.03 and 1.06, yielding slightly lower gold prices expressed in the local currency. In Australian dollars, the price of gold started the year at $1675/oz and followed a similar price fall, rise and fall course to that expressed in United States dollars, ending the year on $1600/oz. In general, the Australian gold price throughout 2012 was about $50/oz lower than the second half of 2011, but more than $150/oz higher than the first half of the same year (Figure 1). In April 2013, the gold price in US dollars dropped about 25% to US$1200 and subsequently rebounded to around US$1320/oz. Despite being partially offset by a corresponding fall in the Australian/US dollar exchange rate to about 0.93, in Australian currency terms the price of gold fell by about 12.5% to between $1380 and $1450/oz by mid-2013, or similar to values seen throughout 2010. Allowing for inflation, and expressing the gold price in constant 2012 Australian dollars, the current purchasing power of the commodity remains about double that seen between 2000 and 2005. The main impact of the recent, rapid downward correction has been the closure of some high cost mines and an increase in difficulty for companies to raise market capital. Given the continuing demand for gold, observers have suggested that the recent price drop has been driven by a shift in the equities market towards other areas of investment.
