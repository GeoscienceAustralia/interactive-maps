	Tropical cyclone wind hazard map service created by Geoscience Australia. The service contains the 2015 benchmark hazard map as a raster layer. The map shows the maximum 1-minute sustained wind speeds expected for a given return period, in units of metres per second. Users can select the return period (2 - 10000 years), upper and lower confidence limits, or view the parameters of the underlying distribution (location, shape and scale).
