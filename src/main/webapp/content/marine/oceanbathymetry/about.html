Bathymetry is the study and mapping of seafloor topography. It involves obtaining measurements of the depth of the ocean and is equivalent to mapping the topography on land.

Bathymetry has been used extensively by Geoscience Australia's Law of the Sea Project to determine the foot of slope of Australia's continental shelf, which, in turn, has been used to determine Australia's extended continental shelf. Knowledge about the location of near-surface seamounts and reefs is useful also for the Australian Hydrographic Service External site link to chart shipping hazards.
