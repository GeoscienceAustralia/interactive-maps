The main intermediary datasets relate to surface radiation but also include windspeed, vapour pressure deficit and air temperature. In addition, two 'reference datasets' are included: FAO56 crop reference evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998) and 'PenPan' evaporation (Rotstayn et al. 2006), which is synthetic US Class A pan evaporation. The source data (maximum and minimum air temperature, vapour pressure) are not available through this website (see Jones et al. (2009) for access). Each dataset describes a specific variable for a specific time-step. That is, data are supplied as daily values as well as monthly and annual aggregates/averages. Long-term (1981-2006) annual averages are also provided. Specifics on the source data and the formulations used to generate each variable are outlined fully in Donohue et al. (2009). CSIRO Land and Water is the custodian of this dataset and it can be downloaded from http://www-data.wron.csiro.au/ts/climate/evaporation/donahue For full metadata, can acquire it at the above website or can see the publications: Donohue R. J., McVicar T. R. & Roderick M. L. (2010) Assessing the ability of potential evaporation formulations to capture the dynamics in evaporative demand within a changing climate.

(1960 - 1968). The Atlas of Australian Soils (Northcote et al, 1960-68) was compiled by CSIRO in the 1960's to provide a consistent national description of Australia's soils. It comprises a series of ten maps and associated explanatory notes, compiled by K.H. Northcote and others. The maps were published at a scale of 1:2,000,000, but the original compilation was at scales from 1:250,000 to 1:500,000.",

The IVC dataset was classified into Cleared (annual crops and built up areas), Not Cleared (native forests, shrublands, plantations, perennial crops and water bodies) and Further Investigation Required (native grasslands and minimally modified pasture, horticultural trees and shrubs). The draft version of the Dynamic Land Cover Map presents land cover information for every 250m by 250m area of the country from April 2000 to April 2008. The classification scheme used to describe land cover categories in the Dynamic Land Cover Map conforms to the 2007 International Standards Organisation (ISO) land cover standard (19144-2). These reflect the structural character of vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open grasslands. This dataset was reclassified into Cleared, Not Cleared and Further investigation required. Cleared - Extraction Sites, Bare Areas, Rainfed Cropping, Irrigated Cropping and Irrigated Pasture and Rainfed Pasture Not Cleared - Wetlands, Forbs (open and closed), Tussock, Alpine and Hummock Grasses (Open, Closed and sparse), Shrubs (open and closed), Rainfed Sugar, Irrigated Sugar and Trees (Open, closed, scattered and sparse) and water bodies. To obtain urban areas, the dataset was unioned with the 250k topographic map series obtained from Geoscience Australia. These two datasets were joined together and where they correlated, ie both cleared, or both not cleared, were labelled accordingly, and where there was a conflict it was classified as Further investigation required.",
