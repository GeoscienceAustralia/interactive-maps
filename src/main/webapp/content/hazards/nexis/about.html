	The National Exposure Information System (NEXIS) is a unique modelling capability designed by Geoscience Australia to provide comprehensive and nationally consistent exposure information enabling users to better understand the potential elements at risk in Australia.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	NEXIS is designed to utilise publicly available information, statistics, spatial and survey data to model exposure information about residential, commercial and industrial buildings, institutions (public), infrastructure assets and agricultural commodities.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	NEXIS information is not intended for operational purposes at the building or individual feature level. Its strength is to provide nationally consistent aggregated exposure information irrespective of existing administrative or geographic boundaries.
