The Intertidal Extent product consists of a subset of the forthcoming national scale product generated from the 28 year Landsat archive managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). The AGDC is a collaborative project between GA, CSIRO and the NCI.
</p>

<p>
The archive in the AGDC is managed in a consistent grid format, creating 1 degree x 1 degree tiles to store and analyse surface reflectance Landsat scenes (http://www.datacube.org.au/). The product in this beta release consists of a mosaic of four tiles covering the region from Latitude -24 to -26, and Longitude 152 to 154.
</p>

<p>
The product utilises a continental scale tidal model developed by Oregon State University (http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/tpxo8_atlas.html) to characterise the tidal offset level for each Landsat tile in the AGDC across 28 years of the archive (1987 – 2015).
</p>
<p>
Tidal tagging of each tile allows the archive to be sorted and queried based on the modelled tidal stage. Combined with a water/ non-water classification based on the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) (McFeeters, 1996), the extent of exposed intertidal area is derived for percentile intervals of the full observed tidal range.
