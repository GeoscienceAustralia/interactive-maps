	The National Native Title Tribunal ('the Tribunal') is an independent agency established by the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (‘the Act’).
	The Tribunal comprises a President and Members, who are appointed by the Governor General under the Act to make decisions, conduct inquiries, reviews and mediations, and assist various parties with native title applications, and Indigenous land use agreements (‘ILUAs’).
 
	The Tribunal is supported by the Native Title Registrar, also appointed by the Governor General. Together, the statutory office-holders of the Tribunal, (the President, Members and the Registrar), each have separate and specific functions and responsibilities to perform under the Act.
