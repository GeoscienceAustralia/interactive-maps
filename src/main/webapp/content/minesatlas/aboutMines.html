	This data represents the OZMIN Oracle relational database containing geological and resource information for Australian mineral deposits. OZMIN has been compiled from published references and has been designed so that attribute information can be retrieved and analysed in relation to spatial data contained in geographic information systems. The national mineral deposits dataset contains data on over one thousand major and historically significant mineral deposits for 60 mineral commodities (including coal).

	The mineral occurrence data has been compiled directly from State/Territory Geological Survey databases and aims to provide a national overview of mineral occurrences. It does not attempt to duplicate the complete set of attributes held by each State/Territory Survey but merely highlight an occurrence location with a name and set of commodities. The national overview is based upon an agreed set of attributes namely Occurrenceno - Unique Geoscience Australia Identifier, Sourceno - State/Territory Identifiers, Name of Occurrence, Project, Mining Centre or Group of Occurrences, Commodities - A List of significant commodity names, Class which describes whether it is an occurrence, deposit or mine, Location (Lat/Long, Easting/Northings), Accuracy in metres, and Source. Full attributes will be available by linking directly to the State/Territory databases online. To date all stakeholders have agreed to adopt a National commodity list, however naming conventions and class types have not yet been standardised.
