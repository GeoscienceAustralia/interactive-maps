The responsible development of offshore resources is a high priority for the Australian Government and is directly supported by the annual release of acreage for petroleum exploration. The release enables industry to undertake longer term planning, provides certainty in the release process, ensures access to comprehensive pre-competitive geological and geophysical data, and ensures the provision of quality information about issues that may impact on successful applicants.
