The Australian continent has severe weather can range from isolated thunderstorms to intense low pressure systems affecting thousands of square kilometres. Large scale deep low pressure systems cause widespread flash flooding and gale to storm force winds extending over 400 to 1,000 square kilometres. Earthquakes in Australia are usually caused by movements along faults as a result of compression in the Earth's crust.",
