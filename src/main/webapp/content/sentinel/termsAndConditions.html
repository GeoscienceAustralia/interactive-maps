<h2>SENTINEL Disclaimer Agreement</h2>
<p>Welcome to the redeveloped Sentinel Hotspots monitoring system.</p>

<h3>Please note the limitations of the Sentinel Hotspots mapping system:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Under ideal conditions, the hotspots shown will have been detected within the last 72 hours, depending on regional information received from the last satellite overpass.
	</li>
	<li>
	The hotspot location on any map (no matter how detailed) is only accurate to at best 1.5 km.
	</li>
	<li>
	The symbol used for the hotspot on the maps does not indicate the size of the fire.
	</li>
	<li>
	Not all hotspots are detected by the satellites. Some heat sources may be too small, not hot enough, or obscured by thick smoke or cloud.
	</li>
	<li>
	The satellites detect any heat source that is hotter than normal. As well as fires these may include industrial operations such as furnaces.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
