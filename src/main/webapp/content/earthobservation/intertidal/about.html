The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM v1.0) product is a national scale gridded dataset characterising the spatial extents of the exposed intertidal zone, at intervals of the observed tidal range. It demonstrates the potential of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube to use satellite imagery to model the continental scale extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone. The current version utilises 201,964 Landsat observations for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1987 and 2015 (inclusive).

The model can assist in understanding the extents and relative elevation profile of the intertidal zone, delineating exposed areas at differing tidal heights and stages. Examples of where this knowledge can contribute include environmental monitoring applications for migratory bird species, habitat mapping in coastal regions, hydrodynamic modelling, and geomorphological studies of features in the intertidal zone.

<p>
The Confidence Model layer is designed to highlight regions where changes over the time series do not correspond to the modelled tidal information. This layer acts as a quality assessment of the Relative Extents Model, and can also be used as an indicator of coastal change and/or instability.
