        Geoscience Australia has completed the first phase of an areal map of Australia's coastal geomorphological
        units. Utilising pre-existing GIS datasets procured from local, state and federal government agencies, this
        national scale map conforms to a coastal geomorphology classification scheme developed at Geoscience Australia.

        Phase one consists of a geodatabase containing a series of state wide feature datasets that have been
        reclassified into the national coastal geomorphology classification scheme.

		The Australian Seabeded Features web service describes the distribution of seabed geomorphic features on the
        Australian continental margin, identified and mapped using the Australian Bathymetry and Topography dataset
        (Webster & Petkovic 2005). Twenty one feature types are shown for the seafloor within the Australian Marine
        Jurisdiction, including territories around Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island, Macquarie Island and
        Norfolk Island (Heam & Harris 2008).
