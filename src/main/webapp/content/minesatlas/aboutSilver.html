	According to the World Gold Council, trade in physical gold during 2012 amounted to 4452 tonnes. This is almost 1800 tonnes more than world mine production for the year as estimated by the United States Geological Survey (2660 tonnes; adjusted for actual Australian production). World Gold Council data shows jewellery consumed 1908 tonnes, bullion and coins 1582 tonnes and technology applications 428 tonnes. Central Banks were again net purchasers of gold during 2012.

	The relative scarcity, attractive appearance and malleability of silver make it suitable for use in jewellery, ornaments and household silverware. Its extensive use in coins throughout history has declined over the past 50 years. In Australia, the 1966 50 cent piece was the last coin in general use to contain silver (80% Ag, 20% Cu). Silver is mined and produced mainly as a co-product or by-product of lead, zinc, copper and, to a lesser extent, gold (Au). In 2012, the global supply totalled 32.6 kilotonnes (kt), of which 24.5 kt was mine production (75%) with the balance from scrap, de-hedging and government sales. Consumption was dominated by industrial applications (14.5 kt or 44%), followed by fabrication (10.1 kt or 31% — 5.8 kt for jewellery, 2.9 kt for coins and medals, and 1.4 kt for silverware), and photography (1.8 kt or 6%). The balance of consumption was dehedging of 1.3 kt (4%) and nett investment of 5 kt (15%). The use of silver in the photographic industry has declined steadily since the development of digital photography, dropping from 6.3 kt in 2002 to 1.8 kt in 2012 (source of supply and demand data: www.silverinstitute.org). Industrial uses of silver are varied and include electronics, such as batteries and solar panels, coatings for mirrors, catalysts, construction of high quality musical instruments, biocides in many different guises and many other applications. The use of silver as a biocide is growing and largely replacing the photographic industry as a major use. Silver can be used to prevent bacterial and fungal growth in plastic and textiles as well as an anti-bacterial agent in topical gels, the treatment of wounds and in water treatment.
