WOfS is a satellite imagery product depicting observed surface water across the Australian continent.
</p>
<p>
Geoscience Australia analyses Landsat data to identify areas where surface water may have been present. The Landsat archive incorporates observations from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7. The analysis uses an algorithm to determine were water is or is not present on each image. Water presence is calculated for every available Landsat observation in the archive, and displayed as a summary showing how many times water was observed for every point in Australia in a 25m x 25m grid.
</p>
<p>
In addition every grid cell in WOfS has an associated confidence value. The confidence is a qualitative measure arrived at by examining whether other factors, such as the terrain, are consistent with the presence of water, and how often water has been observed in the cell overall.
