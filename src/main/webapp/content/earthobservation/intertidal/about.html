The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM v1.0) product is a national scale gridded dataset characterizing the spatial extents of the exposed intertidal zone, at intervals of the observed tidal range. It demonstrates the Australian Geoscience Data Cube potential in using satellite imagery to model the continental scale extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone. The current version utilizes 201,964 Landsat observations for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1987 and 2015 (inclusive).

The model can assist in understanding the extents and relative elevation profile of the intertidal zone, delineating exposed areas at differing tidal heights and stages. Examples of where this knowledge can contribute include environmental monitoring applications for migratory bird species, habitat mapping in coastal regions, hydrodynamic modelling, and geomorphological studies of features in the intertidal zone.

<p>
Through attribution of the Lowest Observed Tide (LOT) and Highest Observed Tide (HOT) values modelled for each cell (contained in the Coastal Cells layer), the Relative Extents Model can be used to derive contours and an elevation profile of the observed intertidal zone extent on a cell by cell basis. The ability to create an elevation model relative to Mean Sea Level can then enable the data to be integrated as a complimentary data source, linking shallow water bathymetry and terrestrial elevation models.
</p>
<p>
The Confidence Model layer is designed to highlight regions where changes over the time series do not correspond to the modelled tidal information. This layer acts as a quality assessment of the Relative Extents Model, and can also be used as an indicator of coastal change and/or instability.
