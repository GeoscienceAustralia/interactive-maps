	This displays the layers for SHRIMP, Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and U-Pb. While the data used for SHRIMP and Sm-Nd is from new data releases, the data for Rb-Sr and U-Pb is the same as used in the National Geoscience Datasets service. Some data for Antarctica is included.

	Geoscience Australia's Geochron Delivery system is the retrieval system for geochronological data stored by Geoscience Australia. The system will be continually updated as the volume, variety and quality of available geochronological data increase. The initial (September 2011) release contains only ion microprobe (SHRIMP) data, comprising data from about 560 samples, chiefly derived from Geoscience Australia's previous Geochronology OZCHRON. Migration of further OZCHRON data, and upload of more recent data (including analyses obtained in collaboration with the States and the Northern Territory under the National Geoscience Agreement) is ongoing and continuous.
