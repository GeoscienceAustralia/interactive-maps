The boundaries define areas surrounding continental Australia and the external territories including Cocos Keeling Islands, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, Macquarie Island, Heard and McDonald Islands, and the Australian Antarctic Territory.

These data were compiled in 2004 as part of the draft national benthic marine bioregionalisation which is designed to provide improved knowledge of Australia's seabed. The Biomes represent bio-geographic regions that capture narrow spatial distributions and depth ranges in benthic faunal distributions, based on the assumption that the demersal fish distributions are a surrogate of marine faunal distributions. The narrow spatial distributions were revealed as strong patterns of bathymetric zoning for key indicator species on the upper to mid slope. Due to available data, biomes were only defined in water depths of less than 1,130 m. A total of three biomes were defined: upper slope, mid-upper slope, and mid slope. Each of the biomes is separated by a biotone. The Biomes data set includes the names of units in the attribute table as well as the area and perimeter of each unit.The data contained in this service is not authoritative and has not been updated since 2006.
